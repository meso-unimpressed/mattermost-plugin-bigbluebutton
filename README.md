# About this fork

This fork includes integration to [bbb_joiner](https://github.com/meso-unimpressed/bbb_joiner) to
provide and display external join links that allow mattermost users to join in
from mobile clients and invite external participants to the created room.

To ensure the conference can be joined from the join link returned from
bbb_joiner the conference has to be created as soon as a user initiates it from
this plugin (the upstream version creates the conference only after a user
clicks on the join button). Make sure to set the BBB config variable
`meetingExpireIfNoUserJoinedInMinutes` in `bigbluebutton.properties` to a high
enough value to give users enough time to join the meeting.

# Note
We have updated the Mattermost plugin. Only versions 2.1.0 and above will work with the default BigBlueButton server credentials.

Older versions will, however, continue to work when configured with your own BigBlueButton server.

# BigBlueButton Plugin for Mattermost
BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for online learning. Teams can create, join and manage their BigBlueButton meetings from inside Mattermost.

## Installation and Setup

 1. Go to: https://github.com/blindsidenetworks/mattermost-plugin-bigbluebutton/releases
 2. Download the `tar.gz` file corresponding to your server platform. You do not need to extract the tar file once you download it.![enter image description here](docs_images/download_binary.png)
 3. Inside Mattermost, go to **System Console > Integrations > Integration Management**. Make sure the following are turned to true:
	- `Enable Incoming Webhooks`
	- `Enable Outgoing Webhooks`
	- `Enable Custom Slash Commands`
	- `Enable integrations to override usernames`
	- `Enable integrations to override profile picture icons`
 4. Next you must enable Plugins. Go to **System Console > Plugin Management > Configuration** and set `Enable Plugins` to true. ![enter image description here](docs_images/enableplugins.png)
 Depending on your Mattermost version, an additional step may be required to enable uploading plugins in your Mattermost **config.json** file:
	 - `vi /opt/mattermost/config/config.json`
	 - Under `PluginSettings`, make sure `Enable` and `Enable Uploads` are both set to `true`
	 - Restart your Mattermost with `sudo systemctl restart mattermost` assuming you used *systemd* for Mattermost services
 5. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Management** and upload your `bigbluebutton_<arch>_amd64.tar.gz`. The BigBlueButton Plugin should appear under **Installed Plugins**.    ![
](docs_images/PluginManagement.png)
 6. Before activating the plugin, you must configure the plugin settings. By default, you are given a BigBlueButton test server to try it out. However, you have options.  Like Mattermost, BigBlueButton is open source.  You are (more than) welcome to [setup your own BigBlueButton server](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/install.html#Install_).  If you do, the command `sudo bbb-conf --secret` will print out the server's URL and secret key for configuration with Mattermost.  Alternatively, you can [contact](https://blindsidenetworks.com/contact/) Blindside Networks for [hosting options](https://blindsidenetworks.com/services/).
